CSEIDLProject

We aimed to work on a project that uses deep learning to solve a problem related to the healthcare sector. And since we were working on deep learning, we thought to deal with some datasets involving a lot of images to apply some of the concepts we learned in the class involving classification, convolutional neural networks, and extensions of the same. 

After doing some literature review, we fixated on the MURA dataset, a large dataset for the detection of abnormalities in musculoskeletal radiographs [1]. This research paper talks about a study performed by the Stanford ML group on the MURA dataset, where they compared the performance of their model to the radiologist's performance. So in this project, we replicated the architecture given in the research paper, and once we were successful in doing so, we tried to surpass the performance of the model given in the paper with our deep learning model.
